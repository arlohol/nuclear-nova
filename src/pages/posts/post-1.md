# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-01-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning web dev! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Set up**: First, I created a new project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new files and placing them in the folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
